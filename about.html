        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>

        <div class="content">
            <p><strong>Hi, I'm Erik</strong>. I’m a San José State alum (B.S. in Biology, 2018) and currently work as a Software Project Manager for a NASA contractor supporting spaceflight research and engineering efforts. I am driven by a deep passion for creating solutions where sustainability and technology meet. My work lives at the intersection of innovation and impact - where cutting-edge systems aren’t just built to function, but to make a difference.</p>

            <p>From contributing to spaceflight biology with NASA to scaling sustainable infrastructure with Tesla, I’ve seen firsthand how thoughtful engineering can drive real-world change. I thrive in fast-paced, mission-driven environments, and I’m constantly seeking new ways to merge science, systems thinking, and technology to solve meaningful challenges.</p>

            <p>I love tackling complex problems, designing scalable solutions, and building software and infrastructure that push the boundaries of what's possible.</p>

            <p>Whether it’s through building smarter, cleaner technologies or leading teams through complex technical problems, my goal is simple: engineer a future that works better—for people and the planet.</p>

            <p>Some of my notable achievements include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> Acted as a NASA Payload Developer for over 15 successful scientific research missions aboard the International Space Station</li>
                <li> Led testbed software efforts, from programming to regression and V&V testing for complex high-definition digital camera systems for spaceflight biological research</li>
                <li> Designed autonomous spaceflight cubesats for biological research, from concept through proposal submission, coordinating cross-disciplinary teams and driving the project through all phases of planning</li>
                <li> Led customer experience initiatives across Tesla's North American Charging fleet from concept to execution, managing cross-functional relationships across design, engineering, service, and management</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Outside the Office</strong>
            <p>When I’m not at work, you can probably find me in my garage (or on the trail). I have a long-standing passion for the automotive world - from rebuilding engines to fine-tuning performance setups and off-road modifications. It’s a hands-on outlet that keeps my technical instincts sharp and fuels my love for design, mechanics, and problem-solving on and off the road.</p>

            <p><strong>Let's Connect</strong>
            <p>If you’d like to learn more about me, please reach out <strong><a href="mailto:erikosgood@gmail.com" style="color: inherit;">via email</a>!</strong></p>
